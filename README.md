# 🚗 CAN Bus Based Multi-Node Embedded System

## 📖 Project Description

This project implements a **Controller Area Network (CAN) based communication system** with **three interconnected ECUs (Electronic Control Units / Nodes)**. Each node performs a specific task, and data is exchanged seamlessly over the CAN bus.

### 🔑 Node Architecture

1. **Main Node (ECU-1)**

   * **Connected Devices**:

     * MMA7660 3-axis Accelerometer (via **I²C**)
     * 20x4 LCD Display
   * **Functionality**:

     * Reads motion/tilt data from MMA7660.
     * Generates **interrupt signals** for **Left** and **Right turn indications**.
     * Receives fuel gauge data from Fuel Node and displays the value on the LCD.
     * Acts as the **central controller** for monitoring and display.

2. **Indicator Node (ECU-2)**

   * **Connected Devices**:

     * 7 Active-Low LEDs (for turn indicators).
   * **Functionality**:

     * Receives interrupt signals from Main Node over CAN.
     * Performs **LED shifting patterns**:

       * **Left turn** → LEDs shift from **left to right**.
       * **Right turn** → LEDs shift from **right to left**.

3. **Fuel Node (ECU-3)**

   * **Connected Devices**:

     * ADC-based Fuel Gauge Sensor.
   * **Functionality**:

     * Reads **fuel level data** using ADC.
     * Transmits the fuel gauge value to the Main Node over CAN.
